# mid-term_assignment

The main goal of this project is to rewrite the Floyd-Warshall algorithm with recursion based on an iterative version. Unit tests and performance tests for both versions are also part of the project.

## Installation

The project does not require any external packages or frameworks.

## Usage

Since the iterative version was not written by the author, only suggestions for using the recursive version will be given: 
- Input own graph, users can replace the variable 'graph' with their own matrix representation weighted graph.
- Users can modify the function 'floyd_warshall_recursive'. For example, by changing the function name or adding more arguments.
- Users can customise and visualise their own output generated by this code as they wish.

## Contributing

Users are welcome to add comments and improvements to the code and to share the code.
